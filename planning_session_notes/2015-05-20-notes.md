# Notes Taken May 20, 2015

I am cleaning up the repo and creating a first release (version 1.0.0) for a few reasons:

1. We can give the source code to the National SIAM Chapter or other organizations as reference material.
2. We can package this code in end-of-the-year reports to either the National SIAM chapter or the CSE/CLS program.
3. If we need to give another git workshop in the future, version 1.0.0 will be a great template.
