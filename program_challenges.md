# Programming challenges

We have chosen a small set of programming *challenges* with the idea of generate a small repo with the solutions.  Please commit your code as ``probX_ID.ext``, where ``X`` is the number of the problem, ``ID`` and ``ext`` is the extension of the file. There is a directory named ``./programming_challenges/``, where you should commit your solutions.

## Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
If we do it for numbers under 1000 the sum is 233168. Write a program than compute the sum of the numbers under n.

## Problem 2
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Problem 3
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

## Problem 4
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four,
five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written
out in words, how many letters would be used?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred
and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen)
contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in
compliance with British usage.
