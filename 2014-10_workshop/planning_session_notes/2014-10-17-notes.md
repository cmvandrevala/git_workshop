## Day One - Thursday, October 30th

### Introduction to Version Control (10 minutes)

- What is Version Control?
- Why is Version Control Important?
- Version Control Options Available
    - Client-Server vs. Distributed
- Advantages and Disadvantages of GitHub
    - Excellent for Collaboration in the Open Source Community
    - Not Great for Binary Files (Subversion is Better)

### Work Flow in Computational Science (10 minutes)

- Good Code Practices
- The Importance of Reproducible Research
- Collaboration in Academia
- Useful Skills to Aid Work Flow
    - Markdown
    - Bash

### Setting Up Git On Your Machine (10 minutes)

- Set Up Git (GUI and Terminal)
- Create a New Git Directory (git init)

    - Make Changes to Code
    - Stage Changes for Commit (git add)
    - Commit Changes (git commit)
    - Push to Origin (git push)
- Review Changes
    - View Log (git log)
    - View Staged Changes (git status)
- Recovering Past Versions
    - Organizing Past Versions (MD5 Hash)
    - Recovering a Previous Version (git checkout <hash>)

### Git Branches (30 minutes)

- What is Branching?
- Create a New Branch (git checkout -b <name>)
- Merge Two Branches (git merge <name>)
- Synchronize Two Branches (git rebase <name>)
- List All Branches (git branch)

### Git Delete Commands
