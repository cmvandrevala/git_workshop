Repo for the CSE/CLS Git workshop
==================================

Contains the code and presentation for the git workshop in October 2014.

## Authors
- [Cyrus Vandrevala](http://cyrusvandrevala.com/) attended Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI as an undergraduate student. There, he earned a double major in biomedical engineering and physics. While at Marquette he worked on a couple of research projects including radio and x-ray astronomy of supernovae and the construction of a positron beam using a sodium source. He also held jobs as a tutor, a teaching assistant, and a validation engineer at Boston Scientific (during a co-op work opportunity). Currently, he is a doctoral student in physics at Purdue University, working under the direction of Dr. Sabre Kais and Dr. Yuli Lyanda-Geller. His recent focus has been on the propagation of light in hyperbolic metamaterials. He is studying how one can control light as it travels in a layered system under the influence of an external magnetic field.

**Research Interests:** Computational Physics, Quantum Computing, Metamaterials

- [Nicolas Guarin-Zapata](https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasguarinz/) was born in Medellín-Colombia. He received his degree in 2009 in Engineering Physics in Universidad EAFIT in Colombia, writing his undergraduate thesis in the Design of a Digital Chess Board.  In 2012 received a Master Degree in Engineering with emphasis in Computational Mechanics in the same university, his thesis was related with the Numerical Simulation of Wave Propagation Problems.  From 2010 to 2013 he lecture some undergrad engineering courses (Electricity and Magnetism, Linear Algebra, Introduction to Continuum Mechanics). During 2011 and 2012 he worked in Grupo de Mecánica Aplicada at Universidad EAFIT (Applied Mechanics Group) applying the FEM and the BEM to seismic wave propagation and phononic crystals, as part of the Young Researcher and Innovators Program "Virginia Gutiérrez de Pineda" supported by Colciencias (Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation). Currently, he is pursuing a PhD in Engineering at Purdue University in the Computational Multi-Scale Material Modeling Lab. His focus has been on the modeling of dynamic behavior of naturally-occurring high performance composite materials.

**Research Interests:** Computational Mechanics, Wave Propagation, Acoustics, Design of Materials, Applied Mathematics

## Collaborated Summary
We want you to help us building a summary of some of the Git commands in a summary file located at [`collaborated_summary/summary.tex`](./collaborated_summary/summary.tex). The main idea is to use all of the power of Git for collaborating in the writing of this document.

## Programming Challenges
We have selected some small programming tasks to encourage participants to commit their solutions. The definition of these challenges is in the file [programming_challenges](./programming_challenges/programming_challenges.md).

## Questions and Comments
If you have any, please create a new text file in the ``questions_and_comments`` directory with any questions or comments that you have about the presentation. We will answer them as soon as possible!

## References
We have created a list of interesting (for us) references and it is in the file [References.md](./References.md). If you consider that this list can be improved or extended, feel free to do so.
