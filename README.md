## Authors
- [Cyrus Vandrevala](http://cyrusvandrevala.com/). He attended Marquette University in Milwaukee, WI as an undergraduate student. There he earned a double major in biomedical engineering and physics. While at Marquette he worked on a couple of research projects including radio and x-ray astronomy of supernovae and the construction of a positron beam using a sodium source. He also held jobs as a tutor, a teaching assistant, and a validation engineer at Boston Scientific (during a co-op work opportunity). Currently, he is a doctoral student in Physics, Purdue University, working under the direction of Dr. Sabre Kais and Dr. Yuli Lyanda-Geller. His recent focus has been on the propagation of light in hyperbolic metamaterials. He is studying how one can control light as it travels in a layered system under the influence of an external magnetic field.

*Research Interests:* Computational Physics, Quantum Computing, Metamaterials.

- [Nicolas Guarin-Zapata](https://sites.google.com/site/nicolasguarinz/). Research Topic:  Modeling of the dynamic behavior of naturally-occuring high performance composite materials

Nicolás Guarín Zapata was born in Medellín-Colombia. He received his degree in 2009 in Engineering Physics in Universidad EAFIT in Colombia, writing his undergraduate thesis in the Design of a Digital Chess Board.  In 2012 received a Master Degree in Engineering with emphasis in Computational Mechanics in the same university, his thesis was related with the Numerical Simulation of Wave Propagation Problems.  From 2010 to 2013 he lecture some undergrad engineering courses (Electricity and Magnetism, Linear Algebra, Introduction to Continuum Mechanics). During 2011 and 2012 he worked in Grupo de Mecánica Aplicada at Universidad EAFIT (Applied Mechanics Group) applying the FEM and the BEM to seismic wave propagation and phononic crystals, as part of the Young Researcher and Innovators Program "Virginia Gutiérrez de Pineda" supported by Colciencias (Colombian Department of Science, Technology and Innovation). Currently, he is pursuing a PhD in Engineerin at Purdue University in the Computational Multi-Scale Material Modeling Lab. His focus has been on the modeling of dynamic behavior of naturally-occuring high performance composite materials.

*Research Interests:* Computational Mechanics, Wave Propagation, Acoustics, Design of Materials, Applied Mathematics.
